I decide to get the movie list from the API only one time, when the page is loaded, to aviod high network traffic.
Working with the list in memory I can filter the list and set or unset items as a favorite.
The same information is used to fill out the modal form when the user clics on the movie title.

Third party libraries
I Use the following libraries:

Ract-modal: 
I think using this library is an easy way to show a modl because it has all functionality built, as a developer you only have to add the information/controls that you required.

Ract-icons: 
This is a library that load only the icon that you need to use.

Thinks that I could be improved if I have more time.
As I said at the beginning of the process, I do not have experience working with React, I currently work with Angular, then I had to learn quickly the bases of React to do this challenge, I think there are many things that I can improve like the manage ok arrays and a better UI.
